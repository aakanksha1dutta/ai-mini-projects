# AI Mini Projects
Welcome to my mini projects repo!

These are some projects that I have done in an introductory Artificial Intelligence class, which was my most favorite class I had taken till my sophomore year of undergrad.

These projects are based on Artificial Intelligence fundamentals like state space, search in state space and their optimization. All the projects use graph based data structure.
